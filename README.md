<h2>Sentiment Analysis on Climate Change</h2>

Getting inspired by MATH 2740 - Mathematics of Data Science, I used R to build a system of assessing various perspectives from people during the time of accelerating climate change (from Jan 2024 to July 2024), whether positive or negative

For summary of how this works, I retrieved a list of comments/opinions regarding Climate Change and then split them into tokens, while removing meaningless tokens. Finally utilizing Bing sentiment lexicon to calculate the overall sentiment scores (negative for negativity, positive for positivity) and plotting the outcome. 

The plot reveals a strong and widespread aversion among people toward Climate Change, highlighting their deep concern and opposition to its adverse impacts.
